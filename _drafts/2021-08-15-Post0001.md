## <span style = "color:#d71364">Intro</span>

In this article I want to show you how I made the Victorian Style House.

Buildings like these are not native to me over here in Austria, so I have to rely on internet [references][id1]. In general it is highly recommended to use references - it might feel like cheating but it's not, as long as one does not copy another artist's work completely. Without references, most of my work would not look as detailed as it does, because I simply cannot _always_ remember _everything_.

*Hint: [PureRef][id2] is a great tool when it comes to using references.*

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Step 1: Block-out</span>

The very first step is making a rough block-out of the object or scene. The block-out should only contain simple shapes and usually does not include many details (if any).

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Blockout of the house by only using simple shapes </i></p>

However, proportions and object scales are important at this stage, which means that I chose realistic lengths and heights for the walls and the roof already. I also set up my main camera, but this becomes more important at a later stage when doing lighting and rendering. I just needed a proper setting so I can include similar images throughout this blog.

*Note: this is also the stage where I begin to properly clean up my scene: adding collections for walls, roofs & other components and naming objects (usually not all, but the most important ones). Usually also object-object parenting is done here.*

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Step 2: Adding rough details</span>

When having the basis it is time to add some rough details - not too many, but still some important characteristics:

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Adding rough details - the building comes alive! </i></p>

You can see that I polished the shape of the roof a bit and added some details to the walls and entrance part. I also added placeholders for the windows at this stage. Of course I edited the complete model (not only the front parts), since in the end it should be nice to look at from all sides.

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Step 3: The second iteration of details</span>

Here comes the part that usually consumes most of my time when working on models: it is adding all that lovely details and small objects that finally breathe life to my digital 3D work. Sort of.

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Finished object after step three: many little details were added </i></p>

As you can see I added many details: windows, doors, fences, wooden planking, roof tiles, ...

What I left for a later stage was the roof of the tower in the front since at this stage I was not sure whether to use metal plates or more roof tiles - something that had to be decided with some lighting and colour. So let's move on to the next stage: finally adding some colour!

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Step 4: Getting colourful</span>

Time to move to viewport shading and set up some materials. I basically have two different workflows - depending on what I want the model to use for.

a) When using the model inside Blender only (renders, animations), I create a few different materials inside Blender

b) When exporting the model (for game asset usage, Sketchfab, Gumroad, etc.) I set up a texture with a colour palette as image reference - this workflow is much more time consuming, but allows me to easily share my model with others.

I went with workflow a) here. Here's the result after applying materials to all objects:

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Shaded model </i></p>

I also decided to go with roof tiles for the tower - it just looks better than planes.

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Step 5: Lighting & Rendering</span>

I really like using HDRIs for lighting my scenes and models. I find it is relatively easy to set up and gives clean, realistic results. Other than that I only added a few spot lights on the porch. The building and the windows are prepared so that I could also model the complete inside one day - but since I did not do that yet, I also didn't add lights to the rooms. Let's pretend that no one is home, okay?

As for the render settings: I used cycles with 512 render samples, filmic look, medium-high contrast, 0.2 exposure and 0.95 gamma values. I also set up some simple compositing inside Blender (vignette, denoising):

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Compositing </i></p>

The finished renders are passed to Adobe Photoshop where I can do some more little corrections & post-processing. Enjoy the final renders!

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Update: Some more insight</span>

After getting lots of feedback on my reddit [post][id3] I decided to extend my blog with a few more details. First of all, let me show you the wireframe of the model:

![12_Wireframe.png](https://santema.github.io/blog/assets/images/blogs/0001/12_Wireframe.png "Wireframe")

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Wireframe </i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Wireframe / Render</i></p>

Many people also asked me how I made the rooftiles. Actually that's no big deal! The key is the array modifier: I created a single tile and added three array modifiers in total: one for the horizontal elements (columns), one for the next row with some slight offset (rows1) and another one which duplicates the outcome of the first two (rows 2). The result looks like this:

![11_rooftilesArrays.png](https://santema.github.io/blog/assets/images/blogs/0001/11_rooftilesArrays.png "Rooftile creation")

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Array modifier: model one tile, get lots!</i></p>

For the tower roof I also cut the edges with two boolean modifiers:

<p style="text-align: center;"> <i>Getting in shape with boolean and array modifiers</i></p>

## <span style = "color:#d71364">Outro</span>

I really hope you liked my breakdown - it was the very first of this kind I did!

If you have any feedback, CC or recommendations I'd be glad to hear it so I can improve in the future! Feel free to contact me via mail or twitter (see my contact details below).
