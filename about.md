## <span style = "color:#e1a846"> Hello and welcome! </span>

_San Cubec City_ is an ambitious **one-man** project about creating a low-poly metropole entirely within the awesome 3D open-source software [Blender][id1]. Sounds crazy enough? Let me tell you a bit more...

Hi, my name is Manuel, I'm 31 years old at the time of writing and living in Salzburg, Austria. I'm making a living as a hardware engineer, I love icehockey and playing video games (and helping to develop them) and I'm a super-proud dad.

And you know what?

I absolutely love modelling low-poly stuff in Blender!
I started to work in Blender in 2018 and quickly became obsessed; after the obvious donut and some humble initial models and scenes I decided to stick to the low-poly style. In parallel, I quickly discovered a _weird obession_ in making city buildings, traffic junctions, streets, trains and cars.

After many models, scenes, dioramas and some animations which I shared with the world on my original [twitter][id2] account, I decided it's time for an absolutely insane project. A little upgrade, so to say. This project is what I am now sharing with the world, and via my social media channels you can follow basically all I am doing. However, worth a special mention is this blog itself, as I am using it as my own "devlog" which sometimes might just contain some more detailed information and looks behind the scenes than twitter allows me to share.

I did the [Cubic Worlds][id3] course from CG Boost and I can highly recommend it! Altough being an intermediate course, every lesson is explained in detail and if something is still unclear you can directly ask the tutors in each lection's own comment section.\
The course is about creating assets and scenes in the so-called "Cubic Worlds" style - i.e. only using cubes!

Being a fan of low-poly art, this inspired me to make my very own "Cubic World", but with some slight differences which I'm explaining in [this][id4] post.

The _Index_ tab above is helpful for listing all the blog entries (kinda like a table of contents) and by clicking on _San Cubec City_ or the logo at the top you'll be redirected to the main page. I am also maintaining a wiki (_Encyclopedia_) where you can quickly find lots of interesting information about the city itself. The _Gallery_ contains renders of finished models and scenes.

Thanks for reading my brief introduction and without wasting any more time let's go on with building a metropole!
