## <span style = "color:#e1a846"> Hello and welcome! </span>

_San Cubec City_ is an ambitious **one-man** project about creating a low-poly metropole entirely within the awesome 3D open-source software [Blender][id1]. Sounds crazy enough? Let me tell you a bit more...

Hi, my name is Manuel, I'm 31 years old at the time of writing and living in Salzburg, Austria. I'm making a living as a hardware engineer, I love icehockey and playing video games (and helping to develop them) and I'm a super-proud dad.

And you know what?

I absolutely love modelling low-poly stuff in Blender!
I started to work in Blender in 2018 and quickly became obsessed; after the obvious donut and some humble initial models and scenes I decided to stick to the low-poly style. In parallel, I quickly discovered a _weird obession_ in making city buildings, traffic junctions, streets, trains and cars.

After many models, scenes, dioramas and some animations which I shared with the world on my original [twitter][id2] account, I decided it's time for an absolutely insane project. A little upgrade, so to say. This project is what I am now sharing with the world, and via my social media channels you can follow basically all I am doing. However, worth a special mention is this blog itself, as I am using it as my own "devlog" which sometimes might just contain some more detailed information and looks behind the scenes than twitter allows me to share.

The _Index_ tab above is helpful for listing all the blog entries (kinda like a table of contents) and by clicking on _San Cubec_ at the top you'll be redirected to the main page. Thanks for reading my brief introduction and without wasting any more time let's go on with building a metropole!
