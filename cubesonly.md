The design restriction of the project is to strictly model objects in low-poly style only using **cubes**. Here is why.

I did the [Cubic Worlds][id1] course from CG Boost and I can highly recommend it! Altough being an intermediate course, every lesson is explained in detail and if something is still unclear you can directly ask the tutors in each lection's own comment section.\
The course is about creating assets and scenes in the so-called "Cubic Worlds" style - i.e. only using cubes! Being a fan on low-poly art, this inspired me to make my very own "Cubic World", but with some slight differences which I'll explain below.
