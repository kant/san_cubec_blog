My experiences of planning a metropole without expertise.

## <span style = "color:#e1a846">From Ideas to Facts</span>

After the initial [idea][id1] I began some internet research on _how to build a city_. As funny as it reads, you'll actually find tons of information about that topic and there are quite some big-ass projects going on in reality: Egypt is building a [new capital][id2] (there is no name yet) to relieve congestion in Cairo, Tajikistan recently laid the foundation stone for [Saihoon][id3], a new city in the desert for about 250.000 people and in South Korea they built a new (smart) city near Seoul called [Songdo][id4]. There is a lot going on and from my personal point of view there are a few main factors to consider in all of these projects:

* Location
* Water supply
* Money supply

Luckily, in my case the money aspect can be neglected, but location and water supply should not be disregarded to add a touch of realism. There are many other important aspects to be considered, but the first thing I did was defining a location for the city.

## <span style = "color:#e1a846">The Location</span>

Popular locations for cities are close to the ocean or near/at rivers. I do have my problems with water, though: it just doesn't look good to me in low-poly style. In the beginning, a river flowing through the city was an option, but I rejected the idea later on. Based on my location in real life ([Austria][id5]), I wanted to have some kind of European landscape around the city, i.e. a few mountains which might enable stunning views at the skyline, lots of conifer forests and areas for agriculture and in general lots of green. One target was that the mountains shouldn't be too high close to the city, but could be much higher when further away (maybe with snowy peaks).

The location idea allowed me to make a clear statement regarding the water supply of the city: fresh water either comes from the surrounding mountains or additionally from large groundwater supplies. Due to the city's location, many people could be working in the timber or mining industry or in the agricultural sector. Since higher mountains should not be too close to the city, the location is suitable for an airport and proper connections to free- and highways.

## <span style = "color:#e1a846">The Name</span>

Okay, I admit it! I did get some inspiration from Rockstar naming its recent capital city in GTA 5 "Los Santos" located in "San Andreas County". But I also needed something unique that represents the original project's idea ([using only cubes][id6]) - so the word "cube" had to be in the city's name somehow. Here are the original names I made up:

* Metropoly
* Cubec City
* Cubesport
* San Cubec

Cubec City was my favourite until I came up with San Cubec... and to be honest, it just sounds the best. Metropoly wasn't a bad idea either (and instead of emphasizing _cubes_ it highlights _lowpoly_), but it didn't feel perfect.

_Stay creative!_
